## My VA Audit - Anayltics Review

### Notifications
- No changes/new analytics needed

### Claims and Appeals
Current Analytics: 
1. `Navigation - Link List - Claims and Appeals - Check your claim or appeal status` - top interaction in GA but I have no idea what link this is referring to.
2. I do not see any GA events for "manage all claims and appeals" in Prod
3. `Dashboard- Navigation- View Button - View Claim` - also unsure of where this is coming from but it is a top interaction
4. I do not see any GA events for "Learn how to file a claim"
5. I do not see any GA events for "Review details"



- Possible links for an open claim: "Manage all claims and appeals" and "Review Details"
- Possible links for a no claims: "Learn how to file a claim" and "Manage all claims and appeals"
